          When talking about grammar, case is just the term used to describe the
          form of the word a noun and its qualifiers take depending on its role
          in the sentence's meaning. In other words, it just tells us how the
          noun changes.
          <br />
          <br />
          Unlike languages such as English where the meaning of a sentence is

        order in which the words appear,languages that uses cases (a.k.a. where
        the words changes) show their meaning by using different forms of the
        words. These forms show the word's function—and therefore meaning—in the
        sentence.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="grammar-paragraph">
        ​For example, consider the following sentence in English:
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="grammar-paragraph grammar-p-block">
        <span className="subject">The cat </span>
        <span className="verb">ate </span>
        <span className="direct-object">the cake</span>.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="grammar-paragraph">
        Because "<span className="subject">The cat</span>" comes in front of the
        verb ate then we know that the cat is the one who is doing the eating
        while the cake​ is the thing being eaten by the cat since it comes after
        the verb. In this case, <span className="subject">the cat</span> is
        called the <span className="subject">subject</span> and the cake is the
        direct object since it is being directly affected by the verb. If we
        were to move any of the parts around, then the meaning of the sentence
        would be completely different.

      <br />
      <p className="grammar-paragraph">
        However, Old Norse is a case language much like German, Russian, Latin,
        or Finnish. This means that the order the words show up in the sentence
        is not important or does not determine the meaning. Rather, the
        different words will change (a.k.a. take cases) depending on what role
        it plays in the setnence's meaning. Taking the same sentence in Old
        Norse, it could potentially be written in the following ways and all
        still have the same meaning:
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="grammar-paragraph grammar-p-block">
        <span className="subject">Köttrinn </span>{" "}
        <span className="verb">borðaði</span>{" "}
        <span className="direct-object">kökuna</span>.<br />
        <span className="direct-object">Kökuna</span>{" "}
        <span className="verb">borðaði</span>{" "}
        <span className="subject">köttrinn</span>. <br />
        <span className="verb">Borðaði</span>{" "}
        <span className="subject">köttrinn</span>{" "}
        <span className="direct-object">kökuna</span>. <br />
        <span className="verb">Borðaði</span>{" "}
        <span className="direct-object">kökuna</span>{" "}
        <span className="subject">köttrinn</span>. <br />
        <span className="subject">Köttrinn</span>{" "}
        <span className="direct-object">
          <span className="direct-object">kökuna</span>
        </span>{" "}
        <span className="verb">borðaði</span>. <br />
        <span className="direct-object">Kökuna</span>{" "}
        <span className="subject">köttrinn</span>{" "}
        <span className="verb">borðaði</span>.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="grammar-paragraph">
        Although the words are all rearranged in different ways, the meaning of
        each sentence is exactly the same as the original English sentence.{" "}
        <span className="subject">The cat</span>,{" "}
        <span className="subject">köttrinn</span>, is the subject because the
        form of the word is in the
        <span className="subject">subject form</span> or, the{" "}
        <span className="subject">nominative case</span>. Likewise, we know the
        cake, kökuna, is the direct object of the sentence because it is in the
        direct object form, or the accusative case. So although the word order
        is not the same in each sentence, we know that they all have the same
        meaning because the cases, or forms of the words, show us that the cat
        is acting as the subject of the verb in each sentence and the cake as
        the direct object of verb.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="grammar-paragraph">
        But what would happen if we changed the sentence around? Let's say that
        we have a particularly ravenous cake that had a taste for cats? In
        English, it would like like this:{" "}
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="grammar-paragraph grammar-p-block">
        <span className="subject">The cake</span>{" "}
        <span className="verb">ate</span>{" "}
        <span className="direct-object">the cat</span>.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="grammar-paragraph">
        The same sentence in Old Norse then would appear in these ways:
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="grammar-paragraph grammar-p-block">
        <span className="subject">Kakan</span>{" "}
        <span className="verb">borðaði</span>{" "}
        <span className="direct-object">köttinn</span>. <br />

        <span className="verb">Borðaði</span>{" "}
        <span className="direct-object">köttinn</span>{" "}

        <span className="verb">borðaði</span>{" "}
        <span className="subject">kakan</span>.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="grammar-paragraph">
        Do you see what happened with the words?
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="grammar-paragraph">
        In our first sentence where the cake was the things being eaten, it was
        acting as the direct object and took its accusative form: kökuna.
        However, when it was now doing the eating, it became{" "}
        <span className="subject">the subject</span> of the verb and took its{" "}
        <span className="subject"> nominative </span>form:{" "}
        <span className="subject">kakan</span>.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="grammar-paragraph">
        We saw the same changes with the cat: as the{" "}
        <span className="subject">subject</span>, it took its
        <span className="subject"> nominative</span> form{" "}
        <span className="subject">köttrinn</span> and as the direct object it
        tooks its accusative form köttinn.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="grammar-paragraph">
        Again, it is the way these words appeared or changed that told us the
        meaning of the sentence, whether the cat was the one eating or if it was
        the cake that was eating.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="grammar-paragraph">
        Don't let this fool you or scare you off: word order does exist,
        although it is not so strict. Rather than determining the meaning, it is
        more conventional. In other words, there are certain patterns in which a
        sentence is constructed and these are generally followed. The pattern
        does not tell us the meaning but merely reflects how someone would
        naturally phrase an idea. Luckily, the general word order of Old Norse
        is similar to what we are used to in English. We start with our subject,
        followed by a verb, and then our predicates follow (direct objects,
        indirect objects, etc.). Just as a reminder, while there is a similar
        pattern that Icelandic tends to present its ideas, that pattern does not
        affect the meaning of the sentence in the same way as in Enlgish. It is
        the forms of the words that tell us the meaning and it is on those forms
        that we need to focus.

      <h1 className="grammar-header">Which cases does Old Norse use?</h1>
      <p className="grammar-paragraph">
        Although there are many languages that make use of grammatical cases,
        not every language is alike in which cases they use. Where Latin or
        Russian use 6 and Finnish uses 15 different cases, Old Norse—like
        German—uses 4:
      </p>
      <br />
      <ol>
        <li className="grammar-paragraph-li subject">Nominative</li>
        <li className="grammar-paragraph-li direct-object">Accusative</li>
        <li className="grammar-paragraph-li indirect-object">Dative</li>
        <li className="grammar-paragraph-li possessive">Genitive</li>
      </ol>
      <br />
      <p className="grammar-paragraph">But what do these mean?</p>
      <br />

      <br />
      <p className="grammar-paragraph">
        <span className="subject bold">The nominative</span> is our{" "}
        <span className="subject">subject</span> case. Any word that is the
        subject of the verb will appear in its{" "}
        <span className="subject">nominative</span> form. In other words, any
        time that it is the one doing the action in a sentence, such as
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li className="grammar-paragraph-ul">
          <span className="subject">Bill </span>runs.
        </li>
        <li className="grammar-paragraph-ul">
          <span className="subject">She</span> jumps.
        </li>
        <li className="grammar-paragraph-ul">

      <p className="grammar-paragraph">
        will all be in their <span className="subject">nominative</span> form.{" "}
        <br />
        <br /> This is also true for all words that are equated with the
        subject. Such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li className="grammar-paragraph-ul">
          <span className="subject">Bill</span>,{" "}
          <span className="subject">my friend</span>, is{" "}
          <span className="subject"> a boy</span>.

        <li className="grammar-paragraph-ul">
          <span className="subject">She</span> is{" "}
          <span className="subject">red</span>.
        </li>
        <li className="grammar-paragraph-ul">
          <span className="subject">The dogs</span> are named{" "}
          <span className="subject">JoJo</span> and{" "}
          <span className="subject">Nala</span>.

      <br />
      <p className="grammar-paragraph">
        In each example, the things that came after the verb are equated or
        renaming the word that came before the verb. In grammar, these things
        are called predicate nouns or predicate adjectives. This occurs when the
        verb is a linking verb, thereby linking the what comes before the verb
        with what comes after.

      <br />
      <p className="grammar-paragraph">
        <span className="grammar-sub-title">
          How do we know if a verb is a linking verb?{" "}
        </span>
        <br />
        The simplest way is to see if you could replae the verb with an equals
        sign ( = ). Essentially, a linking verb acts as an equal sign, telling
        us that the information on the one side is the same as the other. For
        example, <span className="grammar-sub-title bold">to be</span> is the
        most common linking verb. Looking at our (modified) first sentence, Bill
        is a boy. If we were to replace the verb
        <span className="grammar-sub-title bold"> is</span> with an{" "}
        <span className="grammar-sub-title bold">=</span> , would it tell us the
        same thing?
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="grammar-paragraph">
        Yes! Bill = a boy is exactly what Bill is a boy means. It is telling us
        that the two words are one and the same.{" "}
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="grammar-paragraph">
        There are other linking verbs aside from to be, such as to be name or
        called. However, the idea does not change. If the verb can be replaced
        with an =, then it is a linking verb. For example, does The dogs = JoJo
        and Nala mean the same as The dogs are named JoJo and Nala?
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="grammar-paragraph">
        Yes! The sentence is telling us that "the dogs" and "JoJo and Nala" are
        the same.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="grammar-paragraph">
        In such occasions as we have this situation, then the{" "}
        <span className="subject">nominative</span> will be used for both what
        comes before the verb and what comes after.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="grammar-paragraph">
        In short, the{" "}
        <span className="subject">
          nominative is used for the subjects and for other words that rename
          the subject
        </span>
        , e.g. Bill (subject), my friend (renaming the subject), and a boy (also
        renaming the subject).

        <span className="direct-object bold">The accusative</span> is our{" "}

        <span className="direct-object">direct object form</span> or its{" "}
        <span className="direct-object">accusative</span> case. For example:
